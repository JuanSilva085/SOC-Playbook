![event-4625](/examples/img/4625.png)


This example is based on a simulated brute force scenario where
multiple failed authentication attempts (Event ID 4625) were detected
for the same local user account in a short time window.

The investigation followed the endpoint suspicious activity playbook,
resulting in classification as a brute force login attempt.
